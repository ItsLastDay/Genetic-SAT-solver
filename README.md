# Genetic-SAT-solver

Academic project, written for course "Functional Programming".  

My work was to produce a SAT (boolean satisfiability problem) solver in Scheme using genetic algorithms, provide vizualizer for solution and write tests for it.  
-Studied genetic algorithms for optimization problems  
-Came up with automatic test generator, that could produce tests of arbitrary length  
-Implemented solution and visualizer in Scheme
